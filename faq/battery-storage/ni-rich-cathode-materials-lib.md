# Ni-rich Cathode Materials FAQ

## What are the material science advantages of Ni-rich cathode compositions?

Ni-rich cathode materials offer significant advantages over traditional NCM (Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese) and NCA (Nickel-Cobalt-Aluminum) chemistries through optimized nickel content exceeding 80% by weight. The increased nickel ratio directly contributes to higher specific capacity (202.3-230.5 mAh/g) and improved volumetric energy density, which is critical for space-constrained aerospace applications.

The material structure plays a crucial role in performance - our M811 cathode material features a hollow particle morphology that reduces lithium-ion diffusion pathways, while ultra-high nickel content cathodes utilize small particle agglomerates to maximize surface area. These structural optimizations result in superior rate capability (81.2% capacity retention at 5C discharge rates) and enhanced thermal stability.

From a manufacturing perspective, our Ni-rich cathodes benefit from reduced cobalt dependency, which not only lowers material costs but also improves supply chain sustainability. The processing parameters are carefully controlled to achieve precise particle size distribution (D50 values ranging from 4.20-10.28 μm), ensuring consistent electrode coating quality and predictable electrochemical performance across production batches.

For sodium-ion applications, both agglomerate and mono-crystal NaNi₁/₃Fe₁/₃Mn₁/₃O₂ cathode materials demonstrate excellent cycling stability (96.21-97.40% capacity retention after 50 cycles at 1C), making them suitable for long-duration space missions where battery maintenance is not feasible.
