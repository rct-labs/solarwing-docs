# Triple Junction GaAs Solar Cell - Technical FAQ

## What manufacturing quality controls are implemented?

The Triple Junction GaAs Solar Cell manufacturing process implements comprehensive quality controls including cleanroom fabrication (Class 1000 or better), automated optical inspection, and electrical performance mapping. Each cell undergoes rigorous testing protocols: thermal cycling (-150°C to +150°C, 100+ cycles), radiation exposure testing (1E15 electrons/cm² at 1MeV), and performance validation under AM0 illumination. Statistical process control monitors critical parameters including anti-reflection coating thickness (80±5nm), gridline resistance (<0.1Ω/sq), and cell efficiency (>30%). Incoming inspection verifies substrate quality, metallization purity, and coverglass integrity. Outgoing testing includes I-V curve analysis, quantum efficiency measurements, and mechanical stress testing. All test data is tracked and archived for traceability, with cells passing all quality gates receiving certification for space flight applications.
