# Micro Cathode Arc Propulsion Module FAQ

## What are the detailed technical specifications and integration requirements for the Micro Cathode Arc Propulsion Module?

The Micro Cathode Arc Propulsion Module operates on solid propellant (Titanium/Tungsten) and requires no external feed system, simplifying integration. The module's dimensions are 100 × 100 × 40 mm with a mass of 600 ± 50 g. It provides an impulse bit in the micronewton-second (μN·s) range, making it ideal for high-precision control. The system communicates via CAN or RS-422 interfaces.

For integration, the module requires a standard power supply and command interface. The discharge frequency is controllable, allowing for flexible tuning of the propulsion performance. The operating temperature range is -15 to +55 °C. The mechanical interface is designed for fast modular assembly. The system's low discharge voltage simplifies power system integration. Full documentation, including ICDs for CAN/RS-422 protocols and thermal analysis, is available to support system integration.
