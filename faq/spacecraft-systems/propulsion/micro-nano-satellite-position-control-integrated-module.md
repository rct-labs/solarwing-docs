# Micro-Nano Satellite Position Control Integrated Module - Technical FAQ

## What are the detailed propulsion system specifications and integration requirements?

The micro-nano satellite position control integrated module utilizes a monopropellant propulsion architecture with HAN-based green propellant, providing superior specific impulse while maintaining non-toxic handling characteristics. System dimensions measure 280×250×400mm with a dry mass of 1.8kg, designed for 6U/12U CubeSat form factors and similar small satellite platforms.

Key technical specifications include operating temperature range of 5-60°C for propulsion functions and 0-65°C for storage conditions, ensuring reliable performance across various orbital environments. The integrated design reduces system complexity through consolidation of thruster valves, propellant tank, pressure regulation, and control electronics into a single modular unit.

Integration requirements include standard mechanical mounting interfaces compatible with typical satellite structures, electrical interfaces requiring 28V power supply, and command/telemetry connections via standard UART or CAN bus protocols. The system supports multiple thrust levels for delta-V budgeting, with typical total impulse capability suitable for mission durations exceeding 5 years in low Earth orbit applications.

The HAN-based propellant offers significant advantages over traditional hydrazine systems, including reduced ground handling requirements, lower toxicity classification, and compatibility with commercial satellite integration facilities. The propulsion system features redundant valve architecture and built-in health monitoring capabilities for enhanced mission reliability.
