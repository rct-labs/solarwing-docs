# Flexible Solar Wings - High Efficiency Solar Power Solutions

> **Official Product Page**: [View on SolarWing.space](https://solarwing.space/products/energy-solar/flexible-solar-wings)

## Overview

SolarWing's Flexible Solar Wings embody a groundbreaking innovation in space power generation technology, delivering exceptional weight optimization and storage efficiency compared to conventional rigid solar arrays. These sophisticated deployable systems are purpose-built for contemporary space applications encompassing satellite networking, deep space exploration, and lunar base operations, where mass limitations and deployment reliability constitute critical mission parameters.

Featuring two distinct configurations - Stacked and Reel-type designs - these flexible solar wings accomplish extraordinary weight reduction reaching 175% compared to traditional rigid arrays while delivering volume-to-power ratios 8 times superior to conventional solutions. The Stacked configuration excels in extensive satellite constellation deployment with 100m² array capacity, whereas the Reel-type design provides expanded coverage up to 220m² for scientific missions and exploration platforms. Both systems integrate advanced deployment mechanisms with demonstrated reliability in space environments.
