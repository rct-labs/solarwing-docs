## Overview

The XHTF1025-S CPT Atomic Clock pioneers space-qualified Coherent Population Trapping implementation, achieving remarkable frequency accuracy within an ultra-compact 86√ó86√ó42mm aerospace-optimized configuration engineered specifically for orbital missions. This advanced timing platform merges the inherent power efficiency of CPT technology with comprehensive space qualification protocols, incorporating radiation hardening systems, thermal vacuum compatibility, and structural robustness essential for extended space deployment. Delivering frequency accuracy to ¬±5√ó10‚Åª¬π¬≤ in disciplined operation while maintaining ultra-low power consumption (‚â§6W steady state), the XHTF1025-S establishes the ideal timing foundation for satellite navigation platforms, spacecraft subsystems, and space-based communication infrastructure.

Developed explicitly for the demanding space environment, the XHTF1025-S features exceptional frequency stability (¬±5√ó10‚Åª¬π‚Å∞ free-running, ¬±5√ó10‚Åª¬π¬≤ disciplined), superior phase noise characteristics (-160dBc/Hz at 100kHz), and extensive interface options including RS422 differential signaling and aerospace-standard connector systems. The system's comprehensive environmental qualifications, supporting vacuum operation from -15¬∞C to +50¬∞C with in-orbit service life exceeding 5 years, position it as the preferred solution for space missions where spatial efficiency, power optimization, and mission reliability represent critical success parameters. From small satellite constellations to spacecraft timing architectures and orbital navigation systems, the XHTF1025-S delivers the precision timing performance vital for mission accomplishment.
