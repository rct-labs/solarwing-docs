## Overview

The XHTF1040B CPT Atomic Clock is specifically engineered for high dynamic environments requiring ultra-low power consumption and robust timing performance under challenging motion conditions. This specialized variant of the XHTF1040 series combines the power efficiency of Coherent Population Trapping technology with enhanced design features optimized for mobile and high-velocity applications. Operating at just 1.5V power consumption while delivering excellent phase noise performance (-145dBc/Hz at 10kHz), the XHTF1040B provides reliable timing reference for mobile satellite navigation systems, dynamic underwater navigation equipment, and portable communication devices experiencing rapid movement, vibration, or changing orientation.

Engineered for applications where traditional atomic clocks would experience performance degradation due to dynamic conditions, the XHTF1040B incorporates specialized design optimizations that maintain frequency stability and timing accuracy during high-acceleration maneuvers, vibration, and rapid orientation changes. The device's comprehensive timing interface, including 1PPS input/output synchronization, TOD short message output, and UART serial communication, provides maximum functionality in a miniature package while maintaining the robust performance required for mobile applications. Whether deployed in high-speed vehicles, mobile platforms, or dynamic equipment, the XHTF1040B delivers the precision timing foundation essential for mission-critical operations in challenging dynamic environments.
