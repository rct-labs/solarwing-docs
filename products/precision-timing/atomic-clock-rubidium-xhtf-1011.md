## Overview

The XHTF1011 High Accuracy Rubidium Oscillator sets the benchmark for rubidium frequency standard technology in extreme environment deployments requiring uncompromising timing performance under severe operational conditions. This sophisticated oscillator delivers exceptional short-term frequency stability down to 5E-12 at 1s (Option-05) while incorporating innovative unlock holding mechanisms that preserve frequency stability during signal interruptions, making it perfectly suited for mission-critical applications where operational continuity is non-negotiable. Optimized for deployment in the most challenging environmental scenarios, the XHTF1011 maintains consistent performance across extreme temperature ranges (-40°C to +70°C) while offering multiple performance configurations and advanced timing capabilities including rapid 1PPS synchronization and comprehensive monitoring infrastructure.

Developed specifically for aerospace, vehicular, and naval platforms where environmental extremes and mechanical forces would compromise conventional timing solutions, the XHTF1011 integrates specialized features ensuring reliable performance under the most demanding conditions. The system's unique unlock holding capability preserves frequency stability during temporary signal disruptions or interruptions, preventing timing drift in mission-critical scenarios. Available in multiple performance variants (Option-05, -10, -30) with outstanding phase noise characteristics achieving -155dBc/Hz at 10kHz, the XHTF1011 delivers the precise timing foundation essential for navigation platforms, communication systems, and military installations operating in the harshest environments conceivable.
