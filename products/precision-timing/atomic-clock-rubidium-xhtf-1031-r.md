## Overview

The XHTF1031R Miniature Rb Atomic Clock represents the ultimate in compact rubidium frequency standard technology, delivering exceptional performance in a remarkably small form factor optimized for space-constrained applications. This miniature timing solution combines rubidium-level frequency stability with ultra-low power consumption (+12V operation) and SA.3 series compatibility, making it ideal for aviation systems, aerospace platforms, and timing infrastructure where size and power efficiency are critical constraints. The XHTF1031R achieves phase noise performance as low as -140dBc/Hz at 1kHz while maintaining excellent temperature stability across wide operating ranges.

Engineered for applications requiring maximum precision in minimal space, the XHTF1031R provides comprehensive timing capabilities in a miniature package that can be easily integrated into existing systems through SA.3 series compatibility. The device features a simple 5-pin configuration supporting 10MHz output, frequency adjustment input, and electronic lock status monitoring, enabling seamless integration into aviation systems, aerospace platforms, and communication networks where space constraints would prevent deployment of larger atomic clocks. Whether deployed in aircraft navigation equipment, satellite timing subsystems, or compact communication systems, the XHTF1031R provides the precision timing foundation essential for mission-critical operations in space-constrained environments.
