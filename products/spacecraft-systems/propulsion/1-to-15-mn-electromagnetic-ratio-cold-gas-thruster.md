> **Official Product Page**: [View on SolarWing.space](https://solarwing.space/products/spacecraft-systems/propulsion/1-to-15-mn-electromagnetic-ratio-cold-gas-thruster)

## Overview

This electromagnetic ratio cold-gas thruster provides 1 to 15 mN of variable thrust output specifically designed for precision spacecraft control. The system employs a contact-free electromagnetic screw mechanism that eliminates mechanical wear while enabling smooth thrust modulation through precise signal control. With its compact Φ21 × 48mm dimensions and lightweight ≤40g construction, this thruster addresses the critical size and mass constraints of modern small satellite platforms.

The device's adjustable thrust range from 1 to 15 mN delivers the accuracy needed for fine attitude control, particularly in formation flying missions and ultra-stable space observatories where micro-Newton precision is essential. The dual FY1–2 electrical connectors with 3-line configuration ensure reliable command interfaces, while the frictionless design prevents mechanical degradation, providing extended operational longevity for challenging space environments.
