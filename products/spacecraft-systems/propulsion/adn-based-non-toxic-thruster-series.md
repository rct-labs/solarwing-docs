# ADN-Based Non-Toxic Thruster Series

> **Official Product Page**: [View on SolarWing.space](https://solarwing.space/products/spacecraft-systems/propulsion/adn-based-non-toxic-thruster-series)

## Overview

This ADN-based non-toxic thruster series delivers advanced green propulsion capabilities for contemporary spacecraft applications. The product line encompasses thrust configurations from 0.2 N to 20 N, utilizing two proprietary ADN monopropellant variants: a medium-energy formulation providing approximately 220 seconds specific impulse, and a high-energy formulation achieving up to 245 seconds. Enhanced catalyst technology improves combustion efficiency and propellant compatibility, positioning this series as an environmentally conscious replacement for conventional hydrazine systems.

The series responds to increasing requirements for safer propulsion solutions while preserving the performance needed for modern satellite operations. The non-toxic, storable ADN propellant removes the dangerous handling procedures typical of traditional chemical propulsion, substantially lowering ground processing expenses and safety risks while demonstrating proven orbital performance across diverse spacecraft applications.
