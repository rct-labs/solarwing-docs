> **Official Product Page**: [View on SolarWing.space](https://solarwing.space/products/spacecraft-systems/propulsion/adn-based-single-component-micro-propulsion-module)

## Overview

This ADN-based single-component micro-propulsion module delivers advanced green propulsion capabilities specifically designed for micro and nano-satellite platforms needing quick orbital adjustments and extended attitude control. The system employs high-energy, non-toxic ADN propellant distributed through a solid gas generator mechanism, enabling pre-configured plug-and-play deployment that minimizes integration procedures and time requirements. The unit provides substantial 800 N·s total impulse with robust thrust output, making it suitable for missions requiring significant delta-v performance in limited space envelopes.

Demonstrated flight heritage since 2020 confirms the propulsion module's reliability and effectiveness across multiple space missions. The 110 × 100 × 94mm dimensions paired with 1300g mass create an optimal balance between propulsion capability and spacecraft integration constraints for micro-satellite platforms. RS-422/CAN communication interface options facilitate straightforward spacecraft system integration while the ≥4 years operational duration supports extended mission requirements.
