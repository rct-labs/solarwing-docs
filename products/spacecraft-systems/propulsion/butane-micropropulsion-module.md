> **Official Product Page**: [View on SolarWing.space](https://solarwing.space/products/spacecraft-systems/propulsion/butane-micropropulsion-module)

## Overview

This butane micropropulsion module delivers innovative propulsion technology for small satellite platforms, employing non-toxic liquefied butane as an efficient and safe propellant. The system utilizes self-pressurization and vaporization mechanisms to provide a streamlined cold-gas propulsion solution that removes the complexity and hazards typical of conventional propellants. Embedded control electronics and plug-and-play design facilitate quick deployment and smooth integration with micro and nano-satellite platforms.

Optimized for precise performance, the propulsion system generates accurate thrust output required for fine orbital transfers, attitude control operations, and extended station-keeping activities. The modular construction features TC4 titanium alloy materials for superior durability while preserving a lightweight profile that reduces spacecraft mass impact. The 200 N·s total impulse capability combined with RS-422/CAN communication interfaces delivers an ideal combination of performance, safety, and dependability for contemporary small satellite missions.
