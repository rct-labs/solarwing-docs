# Integrated Propulsion Structure Module

> **Official Product Page**: [View on SolarWing.space](https://solarwing.space/products/spacecraft-systems/propulsion/integrated-propulsion-structure-module)

## Overview

The Integrated Propulsion Structure Module delivers innovative structural-propulsion integration for small satellite platforms. This advanced system combines propulsion capabilities with structural functions in a unified unit, utilizing environmentally friendly HAN-based green propellant that enhances safety compared to conventional toxic propellants. The module's blowdown mode operation and streamlined single-tank design provide exceptional simplicity while maintaining high performance for modern microsatellite applications.

The system architecture centers on a load-bearing propellant tank that serves dual functions as both the spacecraft's primary structure and propellant containment vessel. This approach eliminates separate structural components, achieving significant mass optimization and efficient volume utilization. The compact 350×386×490mm form factor and 7.1kg dry mass make it particularly suitable for microsatellite platforms where space and weight efficiency are critical. Flight-proven on the Longjiang Satellite, this integrated solution delivers dependable performance across diverse space mission profiles.
