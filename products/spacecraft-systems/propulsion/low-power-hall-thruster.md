# Low-Power Hall Thruster

> **Official Product Page**: [View on SolarWing.space](https://solarwing.space/products/spacecraft-systems/propulsion/low-power-hall-thruster)

## Overview

The Low-Power Hall Thruster series delivers innovative electric propulsion technology designed specifically for micro- and nanosatellite missions. These thrusters employ advanced Hall effect acceleration principles to provide outstanding performance for orbit transfer and station-keeping operations while maintaining the compact dimensions and lightweight design required for small spacecraft platforms. The system utilizes high-purity xenon as an inert propellant, achieving excellent specific impulse and propellant efficiency when compared to conventional chemical propulsion systems.

The series provides two power configuration options - the 300W ET-H300-1 and 600W ET-H600-1 variants - enabling mission designers to choose optimal thrust levels based on delta-v requirements and power availability. Both models emphasize high reliability, stable performance across broad temperature ranges, and extended operational lifespan suitable for sustained missions. Flight-proven since 2019, these thrusters have demonstrated exceptional capability in actual space conditions, making them ideal solutions for LEO constellation operations, broadband communication satellites, and remote-sensing applications requiring precise orbital control.
