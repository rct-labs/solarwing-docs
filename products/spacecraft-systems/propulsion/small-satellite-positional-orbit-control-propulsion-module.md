## Overview

The Small Satellite Positional Orbit Control Propulsion Module delivers advanced propulsion solutions engineered specifically for modern small satellite missions requiring reliable and efficient orbit and attitude control capabilities. This sophisticated system employs innovative monopropellant technology with environmentally safe green propellants, including Hydroxylammonium Nitrate (HAN) and Ammonium Dinitramide (ADN), providing exceptional safety advantages over traditional toxic propellants while maintaining high performance characteristics for spacecraft maneuvering operations.

Designed with system simplicity and operational safety as core principles, this module utilizes blowdown mode operation with single-tank structural configuration that substantially reduces system complexity while maintaining robust performance across diverse mission requirements. The efficient 5.7kg dry mass provides excellent mass utilization for small satellite applications where every kilogram impacts mission capability. Flight-proven on the KX-1N satellite, this system has demonstrated validated performance in actual spaceflight conditions, giving mission planners confidence in its reliability for critical orbit transfer and attitude control operations.
