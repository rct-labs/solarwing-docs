## Overview

The Solid Cold-Gas Micropropulsion Module delivers innovative spacecraft propulsion technology, introducing advanced solid gas-generating propellant technology that eliminates traditional safety concerns while maintaining excellent performance characteristics. This next-generation propulsion system integrates a gas generator, storage chamber, advanced control circuitry, and precision sensors into a unified package designed specifically for micro- and nano-satellite applications. The compact 96×96×98mm titanium alloy housing and lightweight 1200g construction provide exceptional integration flexibility for space-constrained spacecraft platforms.

Developed with long-term mission capability as a primary objective, this module employs solid propellant technology that provides superior storage life compared to conventional stored gas systems, eliminating propellant degradation concerns over extended mission durations. The absence of high-pressure components substantially enhances system safety and reduces mechanical complexity while delivering 80 N·s of total impulse for precise attitude and orbit control operations. The modular design architecture delivers excellent scalability, enabling multiple module installations for missions requiring increased delta-v capability while maintaining consistent performance characteristics across all configurations.
