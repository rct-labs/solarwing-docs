## Overview

The Tiny Satellite Position-Controlled Propulsion Module delivers innovative solutions for small satellite constellation propulsion, engineered specifically to meet demanding requirements of large-scale satellite deployments where rapid integration, cost-effectiveness, and batch production capability are essential for mission success. This advanced monopropulsion system utilizes environmentally safe Ammonium Dinitramide (ADN) propellant, providing exceptional safety advantages over traditional toxic propellants while maintaining high performance characteristics for efficient orbit and attitude control operations.

Designed with constellation deployment optimization as a core principle, this module incorporates pre-integration and modular delivery configurations that substantially reduce integration time and complexity for satellite manufacturers and operators. The efficient 600×400×400mm form factor and lightweight 3.6kg dry mass provide excellent space utilization for small satellite platforms while maintaining robust propulsion capabilities. Flight-proven on the NX-1 satellite, this system has demonstrated validated performance in actual constellation applications, providing confidence for large-scale deployment programs requiring reliable, cost-effective propulsion solutions.
