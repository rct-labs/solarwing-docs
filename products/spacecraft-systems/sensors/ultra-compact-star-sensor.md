> **Official Product Page**: [View on SolarWing.space](https://solarwing.space/products/spacecraft-systems/sensors/ultra-compact-star-sensor)

## Overview

Built for CubeSat applications where spatial and power constraints are exceptionally demanding, this ultra-compact star sensor represents the forefront of miniaturization in autonomous star sensing technology. This fully autonomous star sensor delivers outstanding 30″ (3σ) accuracy within an ultra-compact 40×40×67mm footprint weighing just 75g, while consuming only 0.2W of power, making it perfectly suited for the most resource-constrained spacecraft platforms.

The sensor incorporates precision manufacturing with accelerated mass-production capabilities, featuring a miniaturized modular architecture that achieves superior thermal and structural integration while supporting dual communication interfaces (RS-422 & CAN) for versatile spacecraft integration. With completely autonomous operation including swift ≤1.2s full-sky acquisition time and 5Hz refresh rate, this sensor provides professional-tier attitude determination capabilities within extreme CubeSat resource limitations.
